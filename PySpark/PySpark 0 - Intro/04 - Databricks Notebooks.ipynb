It consists of cells, some of which contain formatted text, and some that contain executable Python code. Cells containing text, such as the one you are reading now, are referred to as **markdown cells**. Cells that contain executable code are known as **code cells**."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"1f184200-5e54-4972-a82f-8a0ecbef6b55"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## The Menu Toolbar\n\nLet's take a minute to familiarize ourselves with the menu toolbar at the top of this notebook. We will explain some of these tools in detail, but will leave the remaining items for you to explore. \n\n* **File**. This menu contains tools for saving, copying, renaming, and exporting your notebook as well as other file management tools. Please take a moment to explore the options available to you in this menu.\n* **Edit**. The options in this menu are used to perform a variety of editing tasks such as copying and pasting cells and rearranging cells within a notebook. Please familiarize yourself with these options over time. \n* **View**. This menu provides you with options for customizing the appearance of your notebook. Feel free to explore this at your leasure. \n* **Run All**. This button will execute all of the code in your notebook from start to finish. It does not restart your Python session, so any variables that had been created previously will still exist, even if the cells in which they were defined have since been deleted. \n* **Clear**. This menu item provides tools for resetting your notebook environment. Let's look at each of these.\n  * **Clear Results**. This command will clear the output generated by any code cells that have been executing during this Python session, or during a previous time that the Notebook was open. It will not clear the state of your Python sessions. ***I recommend that you run this command any time you re-open a lesson notebook.***\n  * **Clear State**. This command will reset your Python session, removing any variables that have been previously defined. It does not clear the output from the notebook.\n  * **Clear State & Results**. As the name suggests, this tool will perform the functions of both of the previous two commands.\n  * **Clear State & Run All**. This command resets the Python session and then executes every cell in the notebook from top to botoom. ***You should run this command just before submitting any homework assignment or project.***\n\n\n**Note:** Before proceeding any further in this notebook, I recommend clicking **Clear > Clear Results** so that you will be viewing a fresh notebook with no output displayed."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"cf23685f-10cb-4420-80dd-5bf446f832cf"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Attaching a Cluster\n\nBefore we can run any of the code cells in this notebook, we must first attach the notebook to a running cluster.
