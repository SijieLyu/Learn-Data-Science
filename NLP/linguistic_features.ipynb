The difference is that a stemmer operates on a single word without knowledge of the context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words that have different meanings depending on the part of speech. However, stemmers are typically easier to implement and run faster. The reduced \"accuracy\" may not matter for some applications. In fact, when used within information retrieval systems, stemming improves query recall accuracy, or true positive rate, when compared to lemmatization. Nonetheless, stemming reduces precision, or the proportion of positively-labeled instances that are actually positive, for such systems.\n","\n","For instance:\n","\n","+ The word \"better\" has \"good\" as its lemma. This link is missed by stemming, as it requires a dictionary look-up.\n","+ The word \"walk\" is the base form for the word \"walking\", and hence this is matched in both stemming and lemmatization.\n","+ The word \"meeting\" can be either the base form of a noun or a form of a verb (\"to meet\") depending on the context, e.g., \"in our last meeting\" or \"We are meeting again tomorrow\".
