Machine learning models are trained to perform certain tasks through trial and error, rather than by following a set of rules that have been explicitly programmed by a human. In many cases, this approach is simpler to implement than developing explicit rules, and is often more effective."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"d74ff502-7a93-4f47-9d72-19b85d253ca1"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Applications of Machine Learning\n\nMachine learning has applications in many fields.
